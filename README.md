# Captive Portal Authentication UI Example
This repository contains an HTML example demonstrating how a typical captive portal authentication page looks and functions. Captive portals are commonly used in public Wi-Fi networks or restricted-access networks, prompting users to authenticate before accessing the internet.

## Purpose
The purpose of this example is to visually showcase the common structure and design of captive portal authentication pages. It can be used for educational purposes or as a reference for developing your own captive portal UI.

## Features
* **Custom authentication form**: Includes fields for username and password.
* **Checkbox for terms and conditions**: Users must agree to the terms and conditions before logging in, enforced by a checkbox and a disabled login button until it's checked.
* **Scrollable terms and conditions**: Displays the terms and conditions in a scrollable container.

## Preview
You can view the example by opening the `Login Page.html` file in your web browser.
